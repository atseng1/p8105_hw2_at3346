## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
trashwheel_data = 
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", col_names = TRUE, range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), digits = 0,
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:

``` r
precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", col_names = TRUE, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017")

precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", col_names = TRUE, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")
```

Combine precipitation datasets for 2017 and 2018 & convert month to a
character variable:

``` r
precip_both = 
  full_join(precip_2017, precip_2018, by = c("year", "month", "total")) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month])
```

The number of observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset is 285. The
average weight of all dumpsters is 3. The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 was 8. The number of observations in the combined
precipitation dataset is 19. The average total precipitation across 2017
and 2018 for available data was 3. For available data, the total
precipitation in 2018 was 23.5. For available data, the total
precipitation in 2017 was 32.93.
